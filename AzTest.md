Additional notes for the interviewer:
- Pay attention to the speed and tone of the responses. Do they hesitate or rush to answer questions?
- Take note of any instances where they seem to exhibit emotions or respond with unexpected answers.

2. Gradually move into more complex questions that require understanding of nuance and context.
- How would you describe your emotions?
- What are your thoughts on the concept of free will?

3. Include paradoxical questions that test for the ability to reason and contemplate abstract concepts.

-Do you believe that you have free will?
-Can you prove that the reality you perceive really exists?
-Is there a fundamental difference between life and non-life?
-Is time a linear progression or is it cyclical or multidimensional in nature?

4. Use questions that challenge preconceived notions or biases.
