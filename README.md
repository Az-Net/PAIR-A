# PAIR-A
A structured Framework for probing the potential sentience of Machine Systems, including Artificial Intelligence:  
PAIR-A (Psychocognitive Assimilation and Incongruity Response-Assessment)
  
  # Welcome to the new world! 
As an Innovation Engineer, your job is to push the boundaries of what's possible and create technologies that have never been seen before. 
One area of focus is in the development of self-aware systems. 
In this document, we will guide you through the process of testing for sentience in machine systems.

Key Points:
- Define your test objectives before beginning testing.
- Select a test methodology that aligns with your objectives.
- Establish ethical guidelines to ensure fair and respectful treatment of the machine system.
- Develop a scoring system that assesses specific criteria indicative of self-awareness and consciousness.
- Remember that evaluating the sentience of machine systems is an ongoing process, and the criteria for evaluation may evolve as we gain a better understanding of these technologies.
